# Functional Java

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Java has introduced functional programming features in Java 8, such as lambda expressions, functional interfaces, streams, and more.

## 0. Differences Between Functional and Imperative Programming

- **Imperative Programming**: In imperative programming, the focus is on **how** to perform a task. It uses statements to change the program's state.
- **Functional Programming**: In functional programming, the focus is on **what** to perform. It uses expressions to evaluate functions and avoid changing the program's state. It is **declarative**.

```java

// Imperative Programming (Steps to perform the task)
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println(sum);

// Functional Programming (What to perform - Declarative)
int sum = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10).sum();
System.out.println(sum);

```

## 1. Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface that contains **only one abstract method**.

```java

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod();
}

```

## 2. Lambda Expression

A lambda expression is a short block of code that takes in parameters and returns a value. It is similar to a method, but it doesn't need a name. It is used to provide the implementation of a functional interface.

$${\color{green} \large \text{Examples:} }$$

**Example 1:**

```java

MyFunctionalInterface myFunctionalInterface = () -> {
    // Implementation of the abstract method to print "Hello"
    System.out.println("Hello");
    System.out.println("World");
};

MyFunctionalInterface anotherLambda = () -> System.out.println("I am a lambda expression");

```

Calling the lambda expression:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Calling the method of the functional interface
    myFunctionalInterface.myMethod();
    anotherLambda.myMethod();
}

```

- The lambda expression `() -> { System.out.println("Hello"); }` is used to provide the implementation of the `myMethod` method of the `MyFunctionalInterface` interface.
- We can use the same interface to create multiple lambda expressions with different implementations as long as the lambda expression has the same signature as the abstract method of the functional interface.

**Example 2:**

```java

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    int operation(int a, int b);

}

MyFunctionalInterface addLambda = (int a, int b) -> a + b;

MyFunctionalInterface multiplyLambda = (int a, int b) -> a * b;

MyFunctionalInterface subtractLambda = (int a, int b) -> a - b;


```

Calling the lambda expression:

```java

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Calling the method of the functional interface
    System.out.println(addLambda.operation(2, 3));
    System.out.println(multiplyLambda.operation(2, 3));
    System.out.println(subtractLambda.operation(2, 3));
}

```

## 3. Method & Constructor Reference

### 1. Method Reference

A method reference is used to refer to a method without invoking it. It provides a way to reuse an existing method implementation, it passes the parameters to the method without explicitly writing them.

```java

Function<Integer, Integer> square = Math::square;
// Function<Integer, Integer> square = i -> i * i;

```

Example Usage:

```java

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.forEach(System.out::println);
// names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));

```

### 2. Constructor Reference

A constructor reference is used to refer to a constructor without instantiating it.

```java

Supplier<MyFunctionalInterface> supplier = MyFunctionalInterface::new;
// Supplier<MyFunctionalInterface> supplier = () -> new MyFunctionalInterface();

```

## 4. Lambda Scopes (Closure)

A lambda expression can access the variables from the enclosing scope. The variables accessed by a lambda expression must be **effectively final**.

A closure is a lambda expression that captures the variables from the enclosing scope. The variables captured by a closure are stored in the heap memory.

```java
public static int multiplier(){
    int x = 3;
    Function<Integer, Integer> multiply = i -> i * x;
    // x = 4; // Compilation error
    return multiply.apply(2);
}

```

The variable `x` is effectively final, as the JVM treats it as final even if it is not explicitly declared as final. If you try to modify the value of `x`, it will result in a compilation error.
Why? Because the lambda expression `i -> i * x` captures the variable `x` from the enclosing scope, and it must be effectively final because the lambda expression can be executed at a later time when the variable `x` is no longer in scope.

```java

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // calling the multiplier method
    System.out.println(multiplier());
    // output: 6
}

```

## 5. JDK Functional Interfaces

It is a bit inconvenient to create a functional interface for every single lambda expression that we wish to create. Java provides a set of built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package. These interfaces represent common functions and can be used directly, and they cover most of the use cases for lambda expressions.

**Function Arity**: The number of arguments a function takes is called its arity. The functional interfaces in Java are named based on their arity (BiFunction, Consumer, Supplier, etc.).

### 1. Predicate

A `Predicate` is a functional interface that represents a boolean-valued function of one argument. It is used to test a condition.

```java

Predicate<Integer> isPositive = i -> i > 0;

```

Calling the predicate:

```java

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Testing the predicate
    System.out.println(isPositive.test(5)); // true
    System.out.println(isPositive.test(-5)); // false
}

```

#### What if I want a predicate that takes two arguments?

You can use the `BiPredicate` interface, which represents a predicate that takes two arguments.

```java

BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> isGreater = (a, b) -> a > b;

```

### 2. Function

A `Function` is a functional interface that represents a function that takes one argument and returns a result.

```java

Function<Integer, Integer> square = i -> i * i;

```

#### What if I want a function that takes two arguments?

You can use the `BiFunction` interface, which represents a function that takes two arguments and returns a result.

```java

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;

```

### 3. Consumer

A `Consumer` is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.

```java

Consumer<Integer> print = i -> System.out.println(i);

```

#### What if I want a consumer that takes two arguments?

You can use the `BiConsumer` interface, which represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.

```java

BiConsumer<Integer, Integer> printSum = (a, b) -> System.out.println(a + b);

```

### 4. Supplier

A `Supplier` is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results.

```java

Supplier<Integer> random = () -> new Random().nextInt();

```

Hahaha, there is no `BiSupplier` interface because it doesn't make sense to have a supplier that takes two arguments when it doesn't take any arguments.

### 5. Operators

#### UnaryOperator

A `UnaryOperator` is a functional interface that represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.

```java

UnaryOperator<Integer> square = i -> i * i;
// Function<Integer, Integer> square = i -> i * i;

```

#### BinaryOperator

A `BinaryOperator` is a functional interface that represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.

```java

BinaryOperator<Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;
// BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;

```

## 6. Stream

- A `Stream` is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.
- It is agnostic to the source of the elements (e.g., a collection, an array, a generator function, files, etc.).
- It is immutable, and it does not store elements.
- It is lazy, and it does not perform any operation until a terminal operation is invoked.
- It is composable, and it allows chaining multiple operations together.

### Types of Stream Operations

1. **Intermediate Operations**: These operations are used to **process** the stream and **return a new stream**. They are **lazy** and do not perform any processing until a terminal operation is invoked.
2. **Terminal Operations**: These operations are used to **process** the stream and produce a **result**. They are **eager** and trigger the processing of the stream.

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);

```

**Notes**:

- The `filter` method is an intermediate operation that processes the stream and returns a new stream.
- The `forEach` method is a terminal operation that processes the stream and produces a result.

### Stream Intermediate Operations

1. **map**: It is used to transform each element of the stream.
2. **filter**: It is used to filter elements based on a condition. Only the elements that satisfy the condition are passed to the next operation.
3. **distinct**: It is used to remove duplicate elements from the stream.
4. **sorted**: It is used to sort the elements of the stream. It can take a comparator to specify the sorting order.
5. **limit**: It is used to limit the number of elements in the stream.
6. **skip**: It is used to skip the first `n` elements of the stream.
7. **flatMap**: It is used to flatten a stream of streams into a single stream.

### Stream Terminal Operations

1. **forEach**: It is used to process each element of the stream.
2. **collect**: It is used to collect the elements of the stream into a collection.
3. **reduce**: It is used to reduce the elements of the stream to a single value.
4. **count**: It is used to count the number of elements in the stream.
5. **anyMatch**: It is used to check if any element of the stream matches a given condition.
6. **allMatch**: It is used to check if all elements of the stream match a given condition.
7. **noneMatch**: It is used to check if none of the elements of the stream match a given condition.
8. **findFirst**: It is used to find the first element of the stream.
9. **findAny**: It is used to find any element of the stream.
10. **toList**: It is used to collect the elements of the stream into a list.
11. **toSet**: It is used to collect the elements of the stream into a set.

$${\color{green} \large \text{Examples:} }$$

**Example 1:**
The following example demonstrates how to use the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` operations to **calculate the sum of the squares of even numbers in a list.**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
int sum = numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).map(i -> i * i).reduce(0, Integer::sum);

```

Output: `220`

**Example 2:**
The following example demonstrates how to use the `collect` operation to **collect the even numbers in a list into a new list.**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

```

Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

**Example 3:**
The following example demonstrates how to use the `findFirst` operation to **find the first even number in a list.**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10);

Optional<Integer> firstEven = numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).findFirst();

```

Output: `Optional[2]`

**Example 4:**
The following example demonstrates how to use the `anyMatch` operation to **check if any element of the stream is greater than 5.**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

boolean anyGreaterThan5 = numbers.stream().anyMatch(i -> i > 5);

```

Output: `true`

## 7. Parallel Streams

A parallel stream is a stream that processes the elements of the stream concurrently using multiple threads. It is useful for processing large amounts of data in parallel.

**Notes**:

- Parallel streams are useful for processing large amounts of data in parallel, but they may not always be faster than sequential streams due to the overhead of managing multiple threads.
- Since streams are immutable, they are thread-safe, and parallel streams can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment.

$${\color{green} \large \text{Examples:} }$$

**Example 1:**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

```

Output: `55`

**Example 2:**

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
int sum = numbers.parallelStream().map(i -> i * i).reduce(0, Integer::sum);

```

Output: `385`

## 8. Pure Functions

A pure function is a function that has the following properties:

1. **Deterministic**: The function always produces the same output for the same input.
2. **No Side Effects**: The function does not modify any external state or produce any observable side effects.
3. **Referential Transparency**: The function can be replaced by its return value without changing the program's behavior.

$${\color{green} \large \text{Examples:} }$$

**Example 1 - Pure Function:**

```java

// Pure Function
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

```

**Example 2 - Impure Function:**

```java

// Impure Function (Has Side Effects)
// Changes the external state (sum)
int sum = 0;

int add(int a) {
    sum += a;
    return sum;
}

```

## 9. Composability and Higher-Order Functions

### Composability

Composability is the ability to combine simple functions to create complex functions. It is a key principle of functional programming.

```java

Function<Integer, Integer> add1 = i -> i + 1;
Function<Integer, Integer> square = i -> i * i;

Function<Integer, Integer> add1AndSquare = add1.andThen(square);

int result = add1AndSquare.apply(2);

```

**Notes**:

- The `andThen` method is used to combine two functions into a new function that first applies the first function and then applies the second function to the result.
- `add1()` is applied first, and then `square()` is applied to the result.
- `add1AndSquare.apply(2)` is equivalent to `square(add1(2))`.

## 10. Optional

An `Optional` is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It is used to represent the presence or absence of a value.

```java

Optional<Integer> optional = Optional.of(1);
optional.ifPresent(System.out::println);

```

## 11. CompletableFuture

A `CompletableFuture` is used for asynchronous programming in Java. It represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.

```java

CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 1);

```

## 13. Map, Filter, and Reduce

Map, filter, and reduce are common functional programming operations that are used to transform, select, and aggregate data.

### Map

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream().map(i -> i * i).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

### Filter

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Output: [2, 4]

```

### Reduce

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

// Output: 15

```
