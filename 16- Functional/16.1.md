# Functional Java

## 1. Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It can have any number of default or static methods. It can also declare methods from the `Object` class.

```java

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod();
}

```

## 2. Lambda Expression

A lambda expression is a short block of code that takes in parameters and returns a value. It is similar to a method, but it doesn't need a name. It is used to provide the implementation of a functional interface.

```java

MyFunctionalInterface myFunctionalInterface = () -> System.out.println("Hello World");

```

## 3. Method Reference

A method reference is used to refer to a method without invoking it. It is similar to a lambda expression, but it provides a way to reuse an existing method implementation.

```java

MyFunctionalInterface myFunctionalInterface = System.out::println;

```

## 4. Constructor Reference

A constructor reference is used to refer to a constructor without instantiating it. It is similar to a method reference, but it provides a way to reuse an existing constructor implementation.

```java

Supplier<MyFunctionalInterface> supplier = MyFunctionalInterface::new;

```

## 5. Predicate

A `Predicate` is a functional interface that represents a boolean-valued function of one argument. It is used to test a condition.

```java

Predicate<Integer> isPositive = i -> i > 0;

```

## 6. Function

A `Function` is a functional interface that represents a function that takes one argument and returns a result.

```java

Function<Integer, Integer> square = i -> i * i;

```

## 7. Consumer

A `Consumer` is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.

```java

Consumer<Integer> print = i -> System.out.println(i);

```

## 8. Supplier

A `Supplier` is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results.

```java

Supplier<Integer> random = () -> new Random().nextInt();

```

## 9. Stream

A `Stream` is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);

```

## 10. Optional

An `Optional` is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It is used to represent the presence or absence of a value.

```java

Optional<Integer> optional = Optional.of(1);
optional.ifPresent(System.out::println);

```

## 11. CompletableFuture

A `CompletableFuture` is used for asynchronous programming in Java. It represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.

```java

CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 1);

```

## 12. Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

```

## 13. Map, Filter, and Reduce

Map, filter, and reduce are common functional programming operations that are used to transform, select, and aggregate data.

### Map

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream().map(i -> i * i).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

### Filter

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Output: [2, 4]

```

### Reduce

```java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

// Output: 15

```
