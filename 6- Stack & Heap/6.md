# Stack & Heap in Java (Memory Management)

In Java, memory is divided into two main parts: the stack and the heap. Understanding how these two memory areas work is essential for writing efficient and bug-free Java programs.

## Stack

Stack memory is used to store local variables and method calls. Each thread in a Java program has its own stack memory, which is created when the thread is started and destroyed when the thread exits. The stack memory is organized in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, meaning that the most recently added item is the first to be removed.
