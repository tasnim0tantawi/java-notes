# JPA - Java persistence API

Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database. It provides a standard way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. JPA is part of the Java EE platform and is implemented by various ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as Hibernate, EclipseLink, and OpenJPA.

## JPA vs. Hibernate

**JPA is the dance, and Hibernate is the dancer.**

JPA is a specification, while Hibernate is an implementation of that specification. JPA provides a set of interfaces and annotations that define the standard way of interacting with a relational database. Hibernate, on the other hand, is an ORM framework that implements the JPA specification and provides additional features on top of it.

## JPA Annotations

JPA uses annotations to define the mapping between Java objects and database tables. Some common JPA annotations include:

- `@Entity`: Specifies that a class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
- `@Table`: Specifies the details of the database table to which an entity is mapped. It allows you to specify the table name, schema, and indexes.
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
- `@GeneratedValue`: Specifies the generation strategy for the primary key values. It can be used with the `@Id` annotation to automatically generate primary key values. For example, `GenerationType.AUTO` generates primary key values automatically, `GenerationType.IDENTITY` uses an identity column in the database, and `GenerationType.SEQUENCE` uses a database sequence.
- `@Column`: Specifies the details of a column in a database table. It allows you to specify the column name, length, nullable, unique, and other properties.
- `@OneToMany`: Specifies a one-to-many relationship between two entities. It is used to define a collection of child entities in a parent entity.
- `@ManyToOne`: Specifies a many-to-one relationship between two entities. It is used to define a single parent entity in a child entity.
- `@JoinColumn`: Specifies the details of a foreign key column in a database table. It allows you to specify the column name, nullable, unique, and other properties.
- `@NamedQuery`: Specifies a named query for an entity. It allows you to define a query using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) that can be executed later by name.
- `@Enumerated`: Specifies the mapping of an enum type to a database column. It allows you to specify whether the enum values are stored as strings or integers in the database.
- `@Temporal`: Specifies the mapping of a `java.util.Date` or `java.util.Calendar` property to a database column. It allows you to specify whether the date and time values are stored as date, time, or timestamp in the database.
- `@Transient`: Specifies that a property should not be persisted to the database. It allows you to mark a property as transient so that it is not included in the database schema.
- `@Version`: Specifies the version property of an entity. It is used for optimistic locking to prevent concurrent updates to the same entity.
- `@Embedded`: Specifies that a property is an embedded object. It allows you to map a complex object to a database table as a part of the owning entity.

## JPA Examples

Let's look at an example of using JPA annotations to define the mapping between Java objects and database tables:

### 1. Entity Class

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "first_name", nullable = false)
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name = "last_name", nullable = false)
    private String lastName;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    @Column
    private Status status; // Enum type

    @Column(name = "email", unique = true)
    private String email;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")
    private List<Address> addresses;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### 2. Enum Class

Enum classes can be used to represent fixed sets of values in JPA entities. It can be mapped to a database column using the `@Enumerated` annotation. There are two ways to store enum values in the database: as strings or as integers.
EnumType.STRING stores the enum values as strings, while EnumType.ORDINAL stores the enum values as integers. It is recommended to use EnumType.STRING to avoid issues when the order of enum values changes.
By default, enum values are stored as EnumType.ORDINAL if the @Enumerated annotation is not specified.

```java
public enum Status {
    ACTIVE,
    INACTIVE
}
```
