# Object Oriented Programming in Java

1. **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
2. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines a data type that includes data members (fields) and member functions (methods).
3. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

## Principles of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**:. Encapsulation acts like a protective wrapper that prevents code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper (class). This is achieved by declaring the class variables as private and providing public methods to access and modify them (known as getters and setters).
2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it. This results in reusability of code.
3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
4. **Abstraction**: Means "show" only essential attributes and "hide" unnecessary information. Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

## Class and Object

1. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines a data type that includes data members (fields) and member functions (methods).

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;
    }
    ```

2. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

    ```java
    Employee emp = new Employee();
    emp.id = 1;
    emp.name = "John";
    ```

## Constructor

1. **Constructor**: A constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee(1, "John");
    ```

2. **Default Constructor**: If a class does not have any constructor, Java provides a default constructor that initializes the object with default values.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee();
    ```
3. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters is called a parameterized constructor.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee(1, "John");
    ```
4. **Constructor Overloading**: Java allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameters. This is known as constructor overloading.

    ```java

    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }

        Employee(int id, String name, double salary) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
        }
    }
    
    Employee emp1 = new Employee(1, "John");
    Employee emp2 = new Employee(2, "Jane", 50000);
    ```
5. **Copy Constructor**: A copy constructor is a constructor that creates an object by copying the attributes of another object of the same class.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee(Employee emp) {
            this.id = emp.id;
            this.name = emp.name;
        }

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Employee emp1 = new Employee(1, "John");
    Employee emp2 = new Employee(emp1);

    ```
6. **Constructor Chaining**: Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor of the same class.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee() {
            this(1, "John");
        }

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee();
    ```

7. **Static Constructor**: Java does not support static constructors. However, static blocks can be used to initialize static variables.

    ```java

    class Employee {
        static int count;

        static {
            count = 0;
        }
    }
    ```

## Inheritance

1. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it. This results in reusability of code.

    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;
    }

    class Employee extends Person {
        double salary;
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee();
    emp.name = "John";
    emp.age = 30;
    emp.salary = 50000;
    ```
2. **Types of Inheritance**:
    - **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from only one class.
    - **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class which in turn inherits from another class.
    - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single class.
    - **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from multiple classes. Java does not support multiple inheritance.

## Polymorphism

### 1. Method Overloading

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different signatures. A method's signature is defined by its name and the number and types of its parameters. Method overloading is also known as compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism. The compiler determines which method to call based on the method's signature.

```java
    class Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        double add(double a, double b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2)); // Output: 3
    System.out.println(calc.add(1.5, 2.5)); // Output: 4.0
```

Another example of method overloading:

```java
    class Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        int add(int a, int b, int c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }

    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2)); // Output: 3
    System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

However, this will result in a compilation error:

```java
    class Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        double add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
```

As the method signature is the same, the compiler will not be able to determine which method to call. Remember, the return type is not part of the method signature.

### 2. Method Overriding

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass. It is used to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass. Method overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism.

```java
    class Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        @Override
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }

    Animal animal = new Dog();
    animal.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
```

## Abstraction

### 1. Abstract Class

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (i.e., you cannot create objects of an abstract class). It can have abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with a body). If a class has one or more abstract methods, it must be declared as an abstract class.

```java
    abstract class Shape {
        abstract void draw();
        abstract void resize();
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Displaying shape");
        }
    }

    class Circle extends Shape {
        void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
        }
    }

    Circle circle = new Circle();
    circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
```

### 2. Interface

An interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to a class. It is a collection of abstract methods.

- Can have only abstract methods and constants (variables that are declared as `final`).
- Cannot have constructors.
- Cannot have non-abstract methods.
- If a class implements an interface, it must implement all the methods declared in the interface.

```java
    interface Shape {
        void draw();
        void resize();
    }

    class Circle implements Shape {
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
        }

        public void resize() {
            System.out.println("Resizing a circle");
        }
    }

    class Rectangle implements Shape {
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
        }

        public void resize() {
            System.out.println("Resizing a rectangle");
        }
    }

    Circle circle = new Circle();
    circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
    circle.resize(); // Output: Resizing a circle

```

## Encapsulation

1. **Encapsulation**: Using setters and getters to access and modify the private fields of a class is known as encapsulation. It is a protective barrier that keeps the data safe within the class.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        private int id;
        private String name;

        public int getId() {
            return id;
        }

        public void setId(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Employee emp = new Employee();
    emp.setId(1);
    emp.setName("John");
    System.out.println(emp.getId()); // Output: 1
    System.out.println(emp.getName()); // Output: John
    ```

## Composition

1. **Composition**: Composition is a design technique in object-oriented programming where a class contains an object of another class. It is a "has-a" relationship.

    ```java
    class Address {
        String street;
        String city;
        String state;
        String country;

        Address(String street, String city, String state, String country) {
            this.street = street;
            this.city = city;
            this.state = state;
            this.country = country;
        }
    }

    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;
        Address address;

        Employee(int id, String name, Address address) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.address = address;
        }
    }

    Address address = new Address("123 Main St", "Springfield", "IL", "USA");
    Employee emp = new Employee(1, "John", address);
    ```

## Static Keyword

1. **Static Variables**: A static variable is a class-level variable that is shared among all instances of the class. It is initialized only once, at the start of the execution.

    ```java
    class Employee {
        static int count = 0;
        int id;
        String name;

        Employee(int id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            count++;
        }
    }

    Employee emp1 = new Employee(1, "John");
    Employee emp2 = new Employee(2, "Jane");
    System.out.println(Employee.count); // Output: 2
    ```

2. **Static Methods**: A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class. It can be called without creating an instance of the class.

 ```java

    class MathUtils {
        static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

    System.out.println(MathUtils.add(1, 2)); // Output: 3
 ```

## Final Keyword

1. **Final Variables**: A final variable is a constant whose value cannot be changed once it has been assigned.

```java
    class Circle {
        final double PI = 3.14;
    }
```

If you try to change the value of a final variable, it will result in a compilation error:

```java
    class Circle {
        final double PI = 3.14;
        PI = 3.14159; // Compilation error
    }
```

2. **Final Methods**: A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

```java
    class Animal {
        final void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        @Override
        void sound() { // Compilation error
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
```

If you try to override a final method, it will result in a compilation error.

3. **Final Classes**: A final class cannot be subclassed.

```java
    final class Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal { // Compilation error
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
```

If you try to subclass a final class, it will result in a compilation error.

## Package

1. **Package**: A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps to resolve naming conflicts when multiple packages have classes with the same name.

    ```java
    package com.example;

    public class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;
    }
    ```

## Inner Class

1. **Inner Class**: An inner class is a class defined within another class. It can access all members of the outer class, including private members.

    ```java
    class Outer {
        int outerVar = 10;

        class Inner {
            int innerVar = 20;

            void display() {
                System.out.println("Outer variable: " + outerVar);
                System.out.println("Inner variable: " + innerVar);
            }
        }
    }

    Outer outer = new Outer();
    Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
    inner.display();
    ```

- To create an instance of the inner class, you need to create an instance of the outer class first.
- The syntax for creating an instance of the inner class is `Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();`.
- The inner class can access all members of the outer class, including private members.
- The outer class cannot access private members of the inner class.
- The inner class can be declared as `static` to make it a static nested class.

2. **Static Nested Class**: A static nested class is a static class defined within another class. It does not have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class.

    ```java
    class Outer {
        static int outerVar = 10;

        static class Inner {
            int innerVar = 20;

            void display() {
                System.out.println("Outer variable: " + outerVar);
                System.out.println("Inner variable: " + innerVar);
            }
        }
    }

    Outer.Inner inner = new Outer.Inner();
    inner.display();
    ```

- The syntax for creating an instance of the static nested class is `Outer.Inner inner = new Outer.Inner();`.
- The static nested class can access static members of the outer class.
