# Object Oriented Programming in Java

1. **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
2. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines a data type that includes data members (fields) and member functions (methods).
3. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

## Principles of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.
2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it. This results in reusability of code.
3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.


## Class and Object

1. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines a data type that includes data members (fields) and member functions (methods).

    ```java
    class Employee {
        int id;
        String name;
    }
    ```

2. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

    ```java
    Employee emp = new Employee();
    emp.id = 1;
    emp.name = "John";
    ```
