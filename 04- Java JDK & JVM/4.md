# Java JDK, JVM, and JRE

Java is a platform-independent language, which means that it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. 

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: The JVM is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It is responsible for interpreting Java bytecode and executing the instructions on the underlying hardware.

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: The JRE is a software package that provides the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), class libraries, and other components needed to run Java applications.

Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is a platform-independent intermediate representation of the program. Java programs are typically compiled into `.class` files, which contain the bytecode for the program. These `.class` files can then be executed by the JVM on any platform that has a compatible JVM installed (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
This means Java is both compiled and interpreted.

1. **Compilation**: Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler (`javac`). The bytecode is stored in `.class` files.

2. **Interpretation**: The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program.
