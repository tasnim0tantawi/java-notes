# Generics

Generics are a way to make components more flexible and reusable. Similar to the idea of variables, but for types.

Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a parameterized type. The parameterized type can be specified at the time of use.

They provide compile-time type safety by allowing you to specify the type of objects that a generic class can work with. This allows you to catch type mismatches at compile time rather than at runtime.

## 1. Generic Classes

A generic class is a class that can work with any type. It allows you to create a class that can work with any data type.

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

In the above example, `T` is a type parameter. It is a placeholder for the actual type that will be used when an object of the `Box` class is created.

```java
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
```

## 2. Generic Methods

You can also create generic methods that can work with any type. The syntax for a generic method includes a type parameter, inside angle brackets, before the return type of the method.

```java
public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
    for (T element : array) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

In the above example, `T` is a type parameter. It is a placeholder for the actual type that will be used when the method is called.

```java

Integer[] intArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
String[] stringArray = { "Hello", "World" };

printArray(intArray);
printArray(stringArray);
```

## 3. Bounded Type Parameters

You can restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type. This is known as bounded type parameters.

```java
public class Box<T extends Number> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

In the above example, `T` is a bounded type parameter. It specifies that `T` must be a subtype of `Number`.

```java
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
Box<Double> doubleBox = new Box<>();
```

## 4. Wildcards

A wildcard is a special character that can be used as a type argument in a parameterized type. It allows you to work with unknown types.

```java
public void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object element : list) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

In the above example, `?` is a wildcard. It represents an unknown type.

```java
List<Integer> integerList = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<String> stringList = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");

printList(integerList);
printList(stringList);
```

### Upper Bounded Wildcards

You can restrict the types that can be used as wildcard arguments in a parameterized type. This is known as upper bounded wildcards.

```java
public void printList(List<? extends Number> list) {
    for (Number element : list) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

In the above example, `? extends Number` is an upper bounded wildcard. It specifies that the unknown type must be a subtype of `Number`.

```java
List<Integer> integerList = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Double> doubleList = Arrays.asList(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5);

printList(integerList);
printList(doubleList);
```

### Lower Bounded Wildcards

You can also restrict the types that can be used as wildcard arguments in a parameterized type. This is known as lower bounded wildcards.

```java
public void printList(List<? super Integer> list) {
    for (Object element : list) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

In the above example, `? super Integer` is a lower bounded wildcard. It specifies that the unknown type must be a supertype of `Integer`.

```java
List<Number> numberList = Arrays.asList(1, 2.2, 3, 4.4, 5);
List<Object> objectList = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");

printList(numberList);
printList(objectList);
```

## 5. Type Erasure

Generics are implemented using type erasure. This means that the type information is removed at compile time and replaced with casts to the appropriate type.

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

The above code is compiled to the following bytecode:

```java
public class Box {
    private Object t;

    public void set(Object t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public Object get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

This is done to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of Java that do not support generics.

## 6. Raw Types

A raw type is a generic class or interface that is used without specifying a type argument. It is a way to use generic classes and interfaces in a non-generic way.

```java
Box box = new Box();
```

It is not recommended to use raw types as they can lead to type safety issues.

## 7. Autoboxing and Unboxing

- **Wrapper classes** are used to represent primitive types as objects. For example, `Integer` is a wrapper class for `int`, `Double` is a wrapper class for `double
- **Autoboxing** is the automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class.
- **Unboxing** is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type.

```java
// Autoboxing
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.set(10);

// Unboxing
int value = integerBox.get();
```

In the above example, autoboxing and unboxing are used to convert between `int` and `Integer`.

Autoboxing and unboxing are done automatically by the Java compiler.

- **Autoboxing** = Primitive type --> Wrapper class
- **Unboxing** = Wrapper class --> Primitive type

## 8. Inheritance with Generics

Generics are not inherited. This means that if you have a generic class `Box<T>`, and you create a subclass `Box2<T>`, the type parameter `T` is not inherited by the subclass.

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}

public class Box2<T> extends Box<T> {
    // T is not inherited
}
```

In the above example, `Box2<T>` does not inherit the type parameter `T` from `Box<T>`. You need to specify the type parameter `T` when creating an object of `Box2<T>`.

```java
Box2<Integer> integerBox = new Box2<>();
```

## 9. Generic Interfaces

You can create generic interfaces in a similar way to generic classes.

```java
public interface Pair<K, V> {
    K getKey();
    V getValue();
}
```

In the above example, `K` and `V` are type parameters. They are placeholders for the actual types that will be used when an object of the `Pair` interface is created.

```java
public class OrderedPair<K, V> implements Pair<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public OrderedPair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

In the above example, `OrderedPair<K, V>` implements the `Pair<K, V>` interface.

```java
Pair<String, Integer> pair = new OrderedPair<>("One", 1);
```
