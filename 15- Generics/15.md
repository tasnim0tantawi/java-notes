# Generics

Generics are a way to make components more flexible and reusable. Similar to the idea of variables, but for types.

Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a parameterized type. The parameterized type can be specified at the time of use.

They provide compile-time type safety by allowing you to specify the type of objects that a generic class can work with. This allows you to catch type mismatches at compile time rather than at runtime.
